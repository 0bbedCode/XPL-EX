**(3) How can I fix 'Module not running or updated'?**

This message means either that:

* The Xposed framework is not running: check if Xposed is enabled and running in the Xposed installer app.
* The XPrivacyLua module is not running: check if XPrivacyLua is enabled in the Xposed installer app and make sure you restarted your device after installing/updating XPrivacyLua.
* There is a problem with the XPrivacyLua service: check the Xposed log in the Xposed installer app for XPrivacyLua problems.
