{"builtin":false,"collection":"Fif","group":"Read battery saver","name":"PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode","author":"Fif","version":1,"description":"This hook prevents apps from detecting that the Android battery saver mode is engaged (Settings > Battery > Battery Saver).\nIt fakes the Battery Saver status to false for any app querying it.\nApplying this hook to an app will prevent it from engaging in any power saving strategy it may apply when the Power Saver is on because it won't be able to detect it anymore.  Use it with extra caution.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Download this hook.\n2. Make sure that the Fif collection is enabled in XPL Pro.\n3.a. In XPL, enable the (new) \"Read battery saver\" group for apps for which you want to fake the battery saver status.\n3.b. Or, in XPL Pro, enable the \"PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode\" hook.\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1a - 2019-09-03\nCorrected  documentation - no Lua code changes.\n\nv1 - 2019-08-31\nFirst public release.","className":"android.os.PowerManager","methodName":"isPowerSaveMode","parameterTypes":[],"returnType":"boolean","minSdk":21,"maxSdk":999,"minApk":0,"maxApk":2147483647,"enabled":true,"optional":false,"usage":true,"notify":false,"luaScript":"-- PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode is a Lua hook definition designed to work                     \n-- with XPrivacyLua.\n\n-- PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode is free software: you can redistribute it and\/or modify\n-- it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n-- the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n-- (at your option) any later version.\n\n-- PowerManager.isPowerSaveMode is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-- but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-- MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
