\n01\/15\n\nDescription: \nGoogle play services provide a cloud messaging system (fcm\/gcm) allowing apps requesting it to have network server\/client communications, this hook prevent that.\nApplications using fcm\/gcm communicate directly with the google play service app through IPC and thus bypass most policy for network firewalling (iptables, aosp network permissions etc.) this is a big concern for advanced users who are using tools like afwall\/netguard\/iptables\/aosp-network-permission as fcm bypass all this when google play services is installed and allowed for networking (which is most of the time the case).\nThis is the main hook, others hooks are optional and meant to hide google play services app and google services framework app, basically the first hook alone do the job, but for a wider coverage we can use all the hooks (15\/15).\nThis hook deny access to fcm\/gcm intent without needing to hook the upstream method bindService (android.os.IBinder) and thus IPC requests timeouts because they don't target google play services anymore (nil target intent).\nThis was a huge concern for me for a long time as google services are essential on most today's android phones but never had the time to tackle it until today.\nThis bundle of hooks can be used along with the similar block applications list access hooks by M66B and Fif_.\nUsing this in combination with aosp-network-permission\/afwall\/netguard should permit a correct network firewalling on android :) ... still not perfect but acceptable.\nThis hooks are provided as is and were not extensively tested, some apps may not like them.\n@intikaa (telegram)\n\nTesting:\nYou can test this hooks with the following apps\nhttps:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=fr.smarquis.fcm\nhttps:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.hippiedevel.firebasenotificationsender\n\nNote: \nPlease make sure all hooks in the set are at the same version!\n\nNote:\nMentioning \"acceptable\" as a firewall bundle solution on android because of the other possible network leaks like requesting an url through the browser or using advanced libraries or exploiting an other IPC etc.\n\nBased on:\nHooks from: M66B and

For any app for which you want the hooks to apply:\n4.a. Toggle the \"Use tracking\" category until it's fully enabled (red) in XPL.\n4.b. Or, alternately, enable both SystemProperties.get\/custom SystemProperties.get.default\/custom hook in XPL Pro.\n\nNote that the builtin hooks SystemProperties.get\/build, \/operator, \/serial, and \/vendor, and their get.default counterparts (8 hooks total) can either complement the \/custom hooks, or the \/custom hooks can completely replace them.\nIt is recommended to use the builtin SystemProperties.get\/operator (and get.default\/operator) for masking the operator as the built-in hooks return valid (but fake) operator ids and countries, while the \/custom hooks would return completely invalid values.\nThe builtin \/build, \/serial and \/vendor .get and .get.default hooks can safely be replaced with this version, provided that you respectively configure the \"Property blacklist (prefixes)\" custom values with:\n  - \"ro.build.\" for replacing the builtin \/build hooks.\n  - \"ro.serialno ro.boot.serialno\" for replacing the builtin \/serial hooks.\n  - \"ro.vendor.\" for replacing the builtin \/vendor hooks.\n\nThe \/custom hooks will generate fake values using this heuristic:\n - If the original value looks like a number or hexadecimal number, the fake value will be a number of same magnitude (number of digits) but with all zeroes.  Eg. 9138474 will become 0000000 and 8d8fe will become 00000.\n - Otherwise the string \"Private\" will be returned.\n\nChangelog:\n\nv5 - 2018-09-30\nActually set the fake value in the hook instead of nil.\n\nv4 - 2018-09-30\nExpanded description field \/ documentation.\nNow the faked value is not nil (crashes Coc), but either a zeroed out number or the string \"Private\".\n","updated":1538372843,"downloads":4623},{"id":51,"collection":"Fif","group":"Use.Tracking","name":"SystemProperties.get.default\/custom","author":"Fif_","version":5,"description":"Please refer to the SystemProperties.get\/custom hook documentation.\n","updated":1538372840,"downloads":4312},{"id":87,"collection":"Fif","group":"Use fingerprint","name":"FingerprintManager.isHardwareDetected","author":"Fif_","version":1,"description":"This hook has nothing to do with privacy.
